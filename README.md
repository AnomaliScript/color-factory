# Color Factory
Hello, I'm Brandon, a high schooler (co27) based in Atlanta, Georgia (US).
I made this webstie to sharpen my skills lin web development and a little bit in JS, but more so in formatting and placing with CSS.
## Usage
This website is a pretty self-explanatory tool, where you can slide "sliders" to adjust the r, g, and b values (red, green, and blue, respectively) to change them, and you can see the reulting color on the left side of the website :)
Unfortunately, the website doesn't display the specific RGB values :(
