    <p>
        Hi, my name is Brandon, and I am a high school student based in the US in Atlanta, Georgia.<br>
        I usually spend my free time coding, listening to music (J-pop and progressive/math rock), learning new languages like Spanish, and spending time learning AI and ML concepts for my science fair project (Regeneron)!<br>
        I also dabble in CADing, using platforms like onShape.  And yes, onShape isn't that good of a CAD platform, it's more of an "introductory" platform; so I'm currently learning how to use SolidWorks :)<br>
        <span class="hidden">jk, I think that onShape is also a good CAD platform, it's just that SolidWorks I think works better for more complex models</span>
